# ANN from Scratch

### Installing

Due to their size, the MNIST data sets are not included in this repository. You will need the CSV versions. Please download them from [pjreddie](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/) and put them into the ./mnist folder.

### Starting

If you run the project locally it needs to be on a local webserver. Otherwise the file accesses won't work. Please leave a message if you run over any issues.
